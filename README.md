## Install

```bash
npm install @uploadcare/upload-client --save
```

## Usage

### High-Level API

To access the High-Level API, you need to create an instance 
of `UploadClient` providing the necessary settings. 
Specifying `YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY` is mandatory: it points to the specific 
Uploadcare project:

```javascript
import UploadClient from '@uploadcare/upload-client'

const client = new UploadClient({publicKey: 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY'})
```

Once the UploadClient instance is created, you can start using 
the wrapper to upload files from binary data:

```javascript
const fileUpload = client.fileFrom(fileData)

fileUpload
  .then(file => console.log(file.uuid))
```

Another option is uploading files from URL, via the `fileFrom` method:

```javascript
const fileURL = 'https://example.com/file.jpg'
const fileUpload = client.fileFrom(fileURL)

fileUpload
  .then(file => console.log(file.uuid))
```

You can also use the `fileFrom` method to get previously uploaded files 
via their UUIDs:

```javascript
const fileUUID = 'edfdf045-34c0-4087-bbdd-e3834921f890'
const fileUpload = client.fileFrom(fileUUID)

fileUpload
  .then(file => console.log(file.uuid))
```

You can track uploading progress:
```javascript
fileUpload.onProgress = (progress => {
  console.log(progress.state)
  console.log(progress.uploaded.loaded / progress.uploaded.total)
  console.log(progress.value)
})
```

Or set callback function that will be called when file was uploaded:
```javascript
fileUpload.onUploaded = (uuid => console.log(`File "${uuid}" was uploaded.`))
```

Or when file is ready on CDN:
```javascript
fileUpload.onReady = (file => console.log(`File "${file.uuid}" is ready on CDN.`))
```

You can cancel file uploading and track this event:
```javascript
// Set callback
fileUpload.onCancel = (() => console.log(`File uploading was canceled.`))

// Cancel uploading
fileUpload.cancel()
```

List of all available high level API methods:

```javascript
interface UploadClientInterface {
  updateSettings(newSettings: SettingsInterface): void

  getSettings(): SettingsInterface

  fileFrom(data: FileData | Url | Uuid, settings?: SettingsInterface): FileUploadInterface

  groupFrom(data: FileData[] | Url[] | Uuid[], settings?: SettingsInterface): GroupUploadInterface
}
```

### Middle-Level API

Also, you can use wrappers around low level to call the API endpoints:

```javascript
import UploadClient from '@uploadcare/upload-client'

const client = new UploadClient({publicKey: 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY'})
const api = client.api
const directUpload = api.base(fileData) // fileData must be `Blob` or `File` or `Buffer`

directUpload
  .then(data => console.log(data.file))

directUpload.onProgress = (progressEvent) => console.log(progressEvent.loaded / progressEvent.total)

// Also you can cancel upload:
directUpload.cancel()

// and set callback to track cancel event:
directUpload.onCancel = () => console.log('File upload was canceled.') 
```

List of all available API methods:

```typescript
interface UploadAPIInterface {
  request(options: RequestOptionsInterface): Promise<RequestResponse>

  base(data: FileData, settings?: SettingsInterface): BaseThenableInterface<BaseResponse>

  info(uuid: Uuid, settings?: SettingsInterface): CancelableThenableInterface<FileInfoInterface>

  fromUrl(sourceUrl: Url, settings?: SettingsInterface): CancelableThenableInterface<FromUrlResponse>

  fromUrlStatus(token: Token, settings?: SettingsInterface): CancelableThenableInterface<FromUrlStatusResponse>

  group(files: Uuid[], settings: SettingsInterface): CancelableThenableInterface<GroupInfoInterface>

  groupInfo(id: GroupId, settings: SettingsInterface): CancelableThenableInterface<GroupInfoInterface>

  multipartStart(file: FileData, settings: SettingsInterface): CancelableThenableInterface<MultipartStartResponse>

  multipartUpload(file: FileData, parts: MultipartPart[], settings: SettingsInterface): BaseThenableInterface<any>

  multipartComplete(uuid: Uuid, settings: SettingsInterface): CancelableThenableInterface<FileInfoInterface>
}
```

### Low-Level API

The Low-Level API is accessible via `api.request()`, here's the basic example,

```javascript
import UploadClient from '@uploadcare/upload-client'

const client = new UploadClient({publicKey: 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY'})

client.api.request({
  path: 'info', 
  query: {
    pub_key: `YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY`,
    file_id: `6db2621d-3ca4-4edc-9c67-832b641fae85`,
  },
})
  .then(response => console.log(response.data))
```

### Settings

#### `publicKey: string`

The main use of a `publicKey` is to identify a target project for your uploads. 
It is required when using Upload API.

#### `baseCDN: string`

Defines your schema and CDN domain. Can be changed to one of 
the predefined values (`https://ucarecdn.com/`) or your custom CNAME. 

Defaults to `https://ucarecdn.com/`.

#### `baseURL: string`

API base URL. 

Defaults to `https://upload.uploadcare.com`

#### `fileName: string`

You can specify an original filename. 

Defaults to `original`.

#### `doNotStore: boolean`

Forces files uploaded with a `UploadClient` not to be stored. 
For instance, you might want to turn this on when automatic file storing 
is enabled in your project, but you do not want to store files uploaded 
with a particular instance.

#### `secureSignature: string`

In case you enable signed uploads for your project, youâ€™d need to provide 
the client with `secureSignature` and `secureExpire` params. 

The `secureSignature` is an MD5 hex-encoded hash from a concatenation 
of `API secret key` and `secureExpire`.

#### `secureExpire: string`

Stands for the Unix time to which the signature is valid, e.g., `1454902434`.

#### `integration: string`

`X-UC-User-Agent` header value.

Defaults to `UploadcareUploadClient/${version}${publicKey} (JavaScript${integration})`

#### `checkForUrlDuplicates: boolean`

Runs the duplicate check and provides the immediate-download behavior.

#### `saveUrlForRecurrentUploads: boolean`

Provides the save/update URL behavior. The parameter can be used 
if you believe a `sourceUrl` will be used more than once. 
Using the parameter also updates an existing reference with a new 
`sourceUrl` content.

#### `source: string`

Defines the upload source to use, can be set to local, url, etc.

#### `jsonpCallback: string`

Sets the name of your JSONP callback function to create files group from 
a set of files by using their UUIDs.

#### `pollingTimeoutMilliseconds: number`

Internally, Upload Client implements polling to ensure that a file 
s available on CDN or has finished uploading from URL.

Defaults to `10000` milliseconds (10 seconds).

#### `maxContentLength: number`

`maxContentLength` defines the maximum allowed size (in bytes) of 
the HTTP response content.

Defaults to `52428800` bytes (50 MB).

#### `retryThrottledRequestMaxTimes: number`

Sets the maximum number of attempts to retry throttled requests.

Defaults to `1`.

#### `multipartChunkSize: number`

This option is only applicable when handling local files.
Sets the multipart chunk size. 

Defaults to `5242880` bytes (5 MB).

#### `multipartMinFileSize: number`

This option is only applicable when handling local files. 
Sets the multipart uploading file size threshold: larger files 
will be uploaded in the Multipart mode rather than via Direct Upload.
The value is limited to the range from `10485760` (10 MB) to `104857600` (100 MB). 

Defaults to `26214400` (25 MB).

#### `multipartMinLastPartSize: number`

This option is only applicable when handling local files.
Set the minimum size of the last multipart part.

Defaults to `1048576` bytes (1 MB).

#### `maxConcurrentRequests: number`

Allows specifying the number of concurrent requests.

Defaults to `4`.

## Testing 

By default, the testing environment is local and requires starting 
a mock server to run tests.

To start a mock server you need to run next command:

```
npm run mock:start
```

and after that you can run:

```
npm run test
```

If you want to run tests on production servers you need to set `NODE_ENV` as `production`:

```
NODE_ENV=production npm run test
```
